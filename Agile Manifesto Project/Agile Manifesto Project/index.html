                                What does "responding to change over following a plan" mean in practice?
                                It means that there is a replacing of a plan with different set of methods to change a project.
                            </p>
                            <p> 
                                Change is inevitable. According to agile methodologies, this gives teams a way to cope and respond to change more effectively.
                                While changes are being made during a development process in a project, it's entirely possible for an agile project
                                to have a plan to build an architecture for a project. Adapting to change in a project, will empower leaders to effectively use technology to explore, create,
                                and interact with content through meaningful, self-directed, and personalized learning experiences.

                                In a business standpoint, change will almost always occur if it is to lower cost of a project or product, an improvement, and many other reasons on changes to a project or product.
                                There are some ways on how to implement change into a business and here are the steps into doing so:

                                <li>Identify the change and preform an impact assessment</li>
                                <li>Communicate the upcoming change or changes to employees</li>
                                <li>Provide reasons for the change</li>
                                <li>Seek employee feedback</li>
                                <li>Launch the change</li>
                                <li>Monitor the change</li>
                                <li>Evaluate the change</li>

                            <p>
                                There can be many fundemental changes throughout a business life time from start to finish if the business goes bankrupt like Toys "R" Us for example.
                                Businesses make these changes not only to keep them in business, but they make changes are also called 'Growth Opportunities'.
                                These opportunities taken by businesses are beneficial from allowing the employees to learn new skills, explore new opportunities in the future, and 
                                exercise their creativity to ultimately create new ideas for more projects and an increased commitment for employees to complete these projects as they come.
                                In addition to taking growth opportunities to improve a business in effectiveness and development department, the business will grow in the amount of cash flow per year which will increase the number of job opportunities in that company or business.
                                This will result in a business cycle: Take advantage of growth opportunities leading to overall improvements in a business and finally an increase in job opportunities and cash flow in a business.

                                The pictures shown here are pictures from a manga/anime serious called Assassination classroom where a class is contracted to kill their, less than human teacher. 
                                During episode 6, the Teacher Koro-Sensei, wants his students to place in the top 50 of the midterm, even after tons of studying and planning, the principal of their prestigeous School Changes the Content covered on the midterm, which keep their class down. 
                                The student having given up and say they just wanna focus on finsihing the contract. Koro-Sensei then directs them giving a speech. He says that "you strive in assassination, but not academics". He then the asks a question to each of the other teacher (who are professional assassins) The first teacher Ms.Yelovitch was asked,  "when you have a target do they go in with one plan?" 
                                The teacher Responds saying "No, if i've learned anything is that the first plan almost never goes the way you expect,there are just too many variables. You need a backup for every contingency". The second teacher Mr. Kurasama Is asked "When training in knife combat is the fisrt strike all that matters?". He respond stating that "The first attack is important but so is the follow up you have to be prepared for every strike or better yet carry A SECOND BLADE." 
                                He tells his students to wield a second blade, saying to never stop adapting and coming up with new plans, becasue those who do not carry a second blade are not fit to be assasins. This is a good metaphor for project managment because there are always so many variables that can take your project and plan a different way. 
                                So when on a porject you must keep a "second blade" on you have a backup, be able to change and create a new plan when your first one changes or doesn't work.

                            <p>
                                Halo, is a well known first person shooter that stands with games like Call of Duty and the other juggernaut of the gaming world selling countless copies. Almost all giants have to start from some where and Halo is no exeption. 
                                Halo was by no means the Halo we know from today. It began its life as a tactical shooter not only that, it began as a sequal to a previous game from Myth. This project was first known as 'Monkey Nuts' but Jason Jones, one of Bungie's co-founders, 
                                decided that he wouldn't be too keen on explaining this title to his mother thus it was changed to Blam! - with an exclamation point, of course. The roots of Halo were in a real time stratagy game not a first person shooter. The game shifted as 
                                they realized that they can use 3D models. Then they began to shift more to a third person shooter. Then shown at Macworld 99 where Steve Jobs and a popular Bungie co-founder, to show the game to the world.
                                The system perfectly displayed the dynamic enviornment with high quality graphics and a wonderful set of AI that reacted to the world around them. 
                                The inital plan was to release in 2000, however they could only release some more information with a new trailer that more closely looked like the Halo that we know with a slightly older version of Master Chief. The 
                                level layout was slightly diffrent with wild life, fog, and audio diffrences. Planning to break into the console market, they teamed up with take 2 interavtice to bring halo to the Mac pc and PlayStation 2. 
                                However, that would not be as Halo would not be as Halo became a Microsoft excluslive and be launched along side the Xbox in November 2001.
